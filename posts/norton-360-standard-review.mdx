With Norton 360 Standard, you can download and install security for your PC, Mac, or mobile device in minutes. It’s designed to provide you with peace of mind without the hassle of complicated setups. The experience feels seamless, so you can get back to doing what you love without any delays.</p> <h3>AI-Powered Scam Protection</h3> <p>Have you ever received what seemed like a too-good-to-be-true offer or an alarming message? You’re not alone. Scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated, which is why Norton’s Advanced AI-Powered Scam Protection is a game-changer.

This is where the VPN feature of Norton 360 Standard shines. With bank-grade encryption, it ensures that your connection is secure, making it difficult for prying eyes to intercept your data. You won't need to worry about who might be snooping on your online activities while you’re enjoying your coffee at a café.</p> <h3>Be Proactive with Dark Web Monitoring</h3> <p>Identity theft is real, and it’s happening more often than you think. Thieves buy and sell personal information on the dark web, making it critical to monitor such activity. Norton 360 Standard takes this off your plate by scanning the dark web for any signs of your personal information being compromised. You’ll receive notifications if anything suspicious is discovered, giving you the opportunity to act quickly.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Norton 360 Standard, Antivirus software for 1 Device with Auto-Renewal – Includes Advanced AI Scam Protection, VPN, Dark Web Monitoring PC Cloud Backup [Download]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QDTSCZQ?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h3>Real-Time Protection Against Malware</h3> <p>The tech landscape is littered with existing and emerging threats, including ransomware and viruses. Real-time protection is crucial, and Norton 360 Standard delivers. It continuously scans for malware without slowing down your device performance. You can continue working or playing without interruptions, while knowing that your system is being protected in the background.</p> <h3>Secure PC Cloud Backup</h3> <p>Have you ever lost precious files or memories when your hard drive failed? It’s a terrifying thought. With 13 GB of secure PC Cloud Backup, Norton 360 Standard has you covered. This feature helps prevent data loss due to ransomware attacks or hardware failures, ensuring that your important files and photos are safe and accessible whenever you need them.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Norton 360 Standard, Antivirus software for 1 Device with Auto-Renewal – Includes Advanced AI Scam Protection, VPN, Dark Web Monitoring PC Cloud Backup [Download]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QDTSCZQ?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h3>Subscription Details</h3> <p>Norton 360 Standard operates on a prepaid subscription basis. You'll need to store a payment method in your Norton account to activate your service. The best part? You won’t be billed until the prepaid term ends. This introductory pricing is especially beneficial for newcomers, allowing you to experience top-notch security without a hefty upfront cost.</p> <h3>The Benefits of Auto-Renewal</h3> <p>One of the biggest headaches with subscriptions is worrying about service disruptions when payments are due. With Norton 360 Standard, auto-renewal means that you can focus on enjoying your protection without the stress of manual renewals. If at any point you decide that the service isn’t for you, you have the flexibility to cancel through your Norton account at your convenience.</p> <h4>Quick Product Overview</h4> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Easy Installation</td> <td>Download and install in minutes for 1 device.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AI-Powered Scam Protection</td> <td>Genie AI assistant to help spot scams in real-time.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>VPN</td> <td>Bank-grade encryption to protect your online activities.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dark Web Monitoring</td> <td>Alerts you if your info is found on the dark web.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Real-Time Malware Protection</td> <td>Protects against ransomware and viruses without slowing down.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Secure Cloud Backup</td> <td>13 GB of storage to keep your files safe.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Payment and Renewal Terms</td> <td>Prepaid subscription with flexible auto-renewal options.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Norton 360 Standard, Antivirus software for 1 Device with Auto-Renewal – Includes Advanced AI Scam Protection, VPN, Dark Web Monitoring PC Cloud Backup [Download]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QDTSCZQ?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h3>Final Thoughts</h3> <p>When it comes to digital security, Norton 360 Standard has positioned itself as a strong contender for anyone looking to safeguard a single device.
