That’s where the VPN feature of Norton 360 Standard 2025 steps in. It uses bank-grade encryption to provide a safer internet connection.</p> <h3>Why Use a VPN?</h3> <p>You might wonder why a VPN is essential. It essentially acts like a secure tunnel for your online activities, masking your IP address and protecting your private information. So if you frequently use public Wi-Fi, say at a café or during travel, knowing that you’re shielded from prying eyes can bring you some peace of mind.</p> <h2>Dark Web Monitoring</h2> <p>Identity theft can feel like a violation of personal space. That’s why Norton 360 includes dark web monitoring. It actively searches the dark corners of the internet where identity thieves sell stolen information.</p> <h3>How Does Dark Web Monitoring Work?</h3> <p>You don’t have to scour the dark web by yourself. Norton does this heavy lifting for you and will notify you if your information gets found in suspicious locations. The reassurance that you can take action if your data gets compromised makes a world of difference.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Norton 360 Standard 2025, Antivirus software for 1 Device with Auto-Renewal – Includes Advanced AI Scam Protection, VPN, Dark Web Monitoring PC Cloud Backup [Download]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q55XCC9?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Real-Time Protection</h2> <p>Imagine getting a notification just when malware is attempting to sneak into your system. With real-time protection, that’s exactly what happens. Norton 360 safeguards you against existing and emerging threats without slowing down your device’s performance.</p> <h3>What Are Emerging Threats?</h3> <p>Emerging threats include those nasty pieces of malware that are crafted to exploit vulnerabilities, like ransomware and viruses. With the shift towards more complex cyber threats, having a robust antivirus solution is a necessity—not an option.</p> <h2>10 GB Secure PC Cloud Backup</h2> <p>Think of all the precious memories you store on your devices. From family photos to important files, sudden losses can be devastating. The 10 GB secure PC cloud backup feature ensures that your data is safe from ransomware attacks and hard drive failures.</p> <h3>How Does Cloud Backup Work?</h3> <p>It’s pretty straightforward. Your crucial files are saved in the cloud, which acts as a safety net. If anything were to happen to your device, you can easily recover your files. This includes everything from school projects to that special photo from your vacation.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Norton 360 Standard 2025, Antivirus software for 1 Device with Auto-Renewal – Includes Advanced AI Scam Protection, VPN, Dark Web Monitoring PC Cloud Backup [Download]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q55XCC9?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Pre-Paid Subscription</h2> <p>Norton 360 Standard 2025 utilizes a pre-paid subscription model that balances affordability with convenience.</p> <h3>How Does the Pre-Paid Model Benefit You?</h3> <p>You won’t have to worry about getting hit with unexpected charges. Instead, you'll set up a payment method in your Norton account to activate the subscription, and no charges will occur until the prepaid term ends.</p> <h2>Auto-Renewal</h2> <p>Forget about service disruptions! With auto-renewal, Norton makes sure you stay protected continuously.</p> <h3>What Should You Know About Auto-Renewal?</h3> <p>The auto-renew feature means you’ll never find yourself without protection, which takes one less item off your to-do list. If you ever decide that you don’t want to renew, canceling is as easy as logging into your Norton account.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Norton 360 Standard 2025, Antivirus software for 1 Device with Auto-Renewal – Includes Advanced AI Scam Protection, VPN, Dark Web Monitoring PC Cloud Backup [Download]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q55XCC9?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Pros and Cons of Norton 360 Standard 2025</h2> <p>Understanding the pros and cons is essential before making any decision.
