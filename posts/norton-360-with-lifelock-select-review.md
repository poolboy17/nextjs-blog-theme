This means you get to respond quickly and take action before potential damage occurs. The peace of mind that comes with knowing you’re protected against identity theft is invaluable.</p> <h4>Identity Alert Features</h4> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Details</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Alerts for Unauthorized Activity</td> <td>Receive alerts for any loans or banking applications made in your name.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Credit Report Monitoring</td> <td>Access and review your credit report monthly to catch inaccuracies.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Restoration Assistance</td> <td>In case of identity theft, a dedicated specialist will assist you in recovery.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>Million Dollar Protection Package</h3> <p>Sometimes, it’s not solely about monitoring; it’s about recovery too.
