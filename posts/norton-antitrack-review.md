Norton AntiTrack offers "privacy beyond VPN," which means it doesn't just rely on VPN technology to maintain your privacy. Instead, it goes a step further by blocking targeted advertisements that try to follow you across the internet. This unique feature gives you peace of mind knowing that your browsing sessions aren’t being used as a commodity.</p> <p>Still, a common concern is whether this might block useful content. Not to worry—Norton allows you to disable the blocking features on sites you trust. It’s all about putting you back in the driver’s seat when online.</p> <h3>Anti-Fingerprinting Technology</h3> <p>Every time you browse the web, websites attempt to collect various pieces of information about you, which can include background details of your device.

Have you ever wanted to know how many times you were tracked during a browsing session? This dashboard gives you an idea of tracking attempts, allowing you to remain aware of how often your data is being accessed.</p> <p>By showing you profiling attempts while you browse, it not only empowers you with knowledge but also helps you evaluate your online habits. You may find it surprising to learn just how prevalent tracking can be.</p> <h2>User Experience</h2> <p>Many users are drawn to Norton AntiTrack not just because of its impressive features but also because of its user-friendly interface.
