With its built-in 4G LTE module, this product ensures that your data flow remains consistent, no matter the circumstance. Packed with features designed for industrial use, the Collie is ready to tackle whatever challenges come its way.</p> <h3>Built-in 4G LTE Module</h3> <p>This gateway is fitted with a standard SIM card slot that supports 4G LTE networks. So, if your Ethernet connection decides to take a break, the GL-X300B instantly switches to a 4G LTE wireless network, allowing constant data transmission. Just a small heads-up: it doesn’t support Verizon Network in the US, so you'll want to keep that in mind when selecting a carrier.</p> <h3>Industrial Hardware</h3> <p>You’ll appreciate the Qualcomm QCA9531 chipset, a standard in the industrial sector. It ensures reliable performance, making it an ideal choice for industrial users who can’t afford downtime. This chipset is built to withstand rigorous conditions and helps prevent breakdowns, so you can focus on your operations without worrying about connectivity issues.</p> <h4>Built-in Hardware Watchdog</h4> <p>Part of the Collie's robust design is a built-in hardware watchdog. If anything goes wrong, this nifty feature can detect problems and trigger a processor reset, ensuring that your systems run seamlessly. This is especially vital in industrial settings where any downtime can lead to costly losses.</p> <h3>Open Source & Secure</h3> <p>If you value open-source software, you’ll be pleased to find that the GL-X300B comes with OpenWrt pre-installed. This makes it a fantastic choice for developers and anyone involved in IoT integration. Plus, it supports more than 30 VPN service providers, including popular options like OpenVPN and WireGuard. Your data security is top-notch, which is essential for any industrial application.</p> <h3>Compact Design</h3> <p>Let’s talk about that design—this gateway features an aluminum alloy shell, making it durable while also looking sleek. Its compact form means you won’t struggle with installation; whether you're mounting it on a wall or tucking it away in a corner, you’ll find it fits right in. The wide range of operating temperatures allows it to perform in tough industrial environments without breaking a sweat.</p> <h3>Easy Configuration</h3> <p>Navigating technology can sometimes feel like navigating a maze, but the GL-X300B aims to simplify that with an intuitive admin panel. It supports AT commands, which lets you manually or automatically dial numbers and check signal strength. So, whether you're a tech guru or a novice, managing and configuring this device is straightforward.</p> <h3>Restrictions to Note</h3> <p>While the GL-X300B is a robust product, it’s important to be aware of some restrictions. Its cellular features are limited in certain locations, including Russia, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimean Peninsula. These limitations arise due to modem restrictions, so if you're operating in these regions, it's good to check alternatives.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="GL-X300B (Collie) 4G LTE VPN Industrial Wireless Gateway, External Full-Band 4G Antennas, Hardware Watchdog, at Command, DNS Encryption, 2.4GHz ONLY (RS485)" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWQSB7CG?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="See the GL-X300B (Collie) 4G LTE VPN Industrial Wireless Gateway, External Full-Band 4G Antennas, Hardware Watchdog, at Command, DNS Encryption, 2.4GHz ONLY (RS485) in detail." href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWQSB7CG?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Key Features Breakdown</h2> <p>Here’s a concise overview of the key features that stand out in the GL-X300B, presented in a clear, easy-to-read format.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>4G LTE Module</strong></td> <td>Built-in SIM card slot supports 4G LTE, ensuring uninterrupted data flow.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Chipset</strong></td> <td>Qualcomm QCA9531 chipset for stable and reliable performance in industrial settings.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Hardware Watchdog</strong></td> <td>Detects failures and triggers processor resets to maintain functionality.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Open Source</strong></td> <td>Pre-installed OpenWrt, supporting over 30 VPN services for enhanced security.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Durable Construction</strong></td> <td>Aluminum alloy shell resistant to harsh environments, designed for mounting or compact storage.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong></td> <td>Admin panel supporting AT commands for dialing, signal checking, and full configuration options.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Geolocation Restrictions</strong></td> <td>Cellular features not available in Russia, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimean Peninsula.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>Real-World Applications</h3> <p>You might be wondering where the GL-X300B can really shine.
