With speeds reaching an impressive AX3000, it can handle multiple devices streaming, gaming, or working simultaneously without any perceived lag. Whether you’re gaming online or streaming your favorite show, this router ensures that everyone in your home can connect without slowdown.</p> <h3>Minimalist Design, Maximum Performance</h3> <p>You’re probably familiar with routers that take up unnecessary space or clash with your home décor.
