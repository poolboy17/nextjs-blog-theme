With its sleek design and impressive features, this pocket-sized gadget transforms the way you connect to the internet, especially when you're on the go.</p> <h3>Key Features Breakdown</h3> <p>Let’s take a closer look at what makes this portable router stand out:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Wi-Fi 6 Technology</strong></td> <td>Supports dual-band combined speeds of up to 1800 Mbps.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Device Connectivity</strong></td> <td>Simultaneously connect up to 120 devices without compromising speed.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Fast Browsing</strong></td> <td>OpenVPN and WireGuard support for secure, high-speed browsing.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>File Sharing Capability</strong></td> <td>Easily share documents through the NAS feature, supporting SAMBA and WebDav.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>OpenWrt Compatibility</strong></td> <td>Customized firmware with enhanced connectivity and reduced interference.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Versatile Usage</strong></td> <td>Converts public networks to private ones for secure internet access.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>Wi-Fi 6: A New Standard in Wireless Technology</h3> <p>Wi-Fi 6 is the latest standard in wireless networks, and the Slate AX is equipped to take full advantage of this technology. With combined speeds reaching 1800 Mbps—600 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band and 1200 Mbps on the 5GHz band—you can enjoy browsing, streaming, and gaming without interruptions. This router allows you to connect to numerous devices at once, making it a perfect choice for families, remote workers, or anyone who loves having multiple gadgets hooked up at the same time.</p> <h3>Fast and Secure Browsing Experience</h3> <p>One of the highlights of the GL-AXT1800 is its strong focus on security. If you're someone who often accesses sensitive information or banking sites while using public Wi-Fi, you’ll appreciate the built-in OpenVPN and WireGuard features. OpenVPN speeds can reach up to 120 Mbps, while WireGuard can go as high as 550 Mbps. This means you can browse securely without sacrificing speed, which is essential for streaming and online gaming.</p> <h3>Easy File Sharing</h3> <p>The Slate AX makes file sharing a breeze with its NAS feature. By connecting an external USB hard drive to the router, you can create your own private network. This gives you the ability to store, share, and access documents seamlessly, whether you’re traveling for work or vacationing with family. With support for protocols like SAMBA and WebDav, sharing files has never been simpler.</p> <h3>Tailored to Your Needs with OpenWrt</h3> <p>Running on OpenWrt 21.02, the Slate AX allows for extensive customization options. You can tailor the router according to your preferences, whether that means optimizing settings for specific uses or installing additional applications. OpenWrt provides a solid platform that significantly reduces signal interference, giving you a reliable connection no matter where you find yourself.</p> <h3>Make Public Networks Private</h3> <p>Have you ever worried about connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, unsure if you’re compromising your privacy? The Slate AX has you covered. It can convert public networks—either wired or wireless—into secure private networks. This ensures that your browsing activity remains private, even when you’re using a less-than-secure public connection. The device works seamlessly with Captive Portal scenarios, allowing you to stay connected without any hitches.</p> <h3>Toggle Your Features with Ease</h3> <p>One feature that stands out is the physical toggle switch that lets you enable or disable specific functions. Whether you want to quickly turn on AdGuard Home or switch to OpenVPN, this feature is intuitive and user-friendly. Just remember to configure it in the admin panel before using the functionality for the first time.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="GL.iNet GL-AXT1800(Slate AX) Portable Gigabit Travel Router, Pocket-Sized, Wi-Fi 6, Extender/Repeater for HotelPublic Network Storage, VPN ClientServer, OpenWrt, Adguard Home, USB3.0, TF Card Slot" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2J7WSDK?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="See the GL.iNet GL-AXT1800(Slate AX) Portable Gigabit Travel Router, Pocket-Sized, Wi-Fi 6, Extender/Repeater for HotelPublic Network Storage, VPN ClientServer, OpenWrt, Adguard Home, USB3.0, TF Card Slot in detail." href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2J7WSDK?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Why You Should Consider the Slate AX</h2> <p>With all these features, it’s easy to see why the GL.iNet GL-AXT1800 is a must-have for travelers.
