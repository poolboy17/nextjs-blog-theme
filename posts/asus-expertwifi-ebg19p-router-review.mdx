<p>What if you could enhance your small or medium-sized business’s internet connectivity solution with a single product? Enter the <strong>ASUS ExpertWiFi EBG19P Gigabit PoE+ VPN Wired Router</strong>. This router promises to provide not just speed and connectivity but also an array of functionalities that can elevate your network management and security. Let’s break down what makes this router a formidable contender for your business needs.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="ASUS ExpertWiFi EBG19P Gigabit PoE+ VPN Wired Router, 8 PoE+ Ports, 123W, Up to 3 WAN ethernet Ports+ 1 USB WAN, Perfect for APs, Commercial-Grade Network Security, Easy Management ExpertWiFi app" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D85KDWML?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Find your new ASUS ExpertWiFi EBG19P Gigabit PoE+ VPN Wired Router, 8 PoE+ Ports, 123W, Up to 3 WAN ethernet Ports+ 1 USB WAN, Perfect for APs, Commercial-Grade Network Security, Easy Management ExpertWiFi app on this page." href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D85KDWML?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Power Over Ethernet (PoE) Functionality</h2> <h3>Why PoE Matters</h3> <p>Power over Ethernet allows you to power devices without needing to run extra electrical wiring. With <strong>8 PoE ports</strong>, the ASUS EBG19P provides up to <strong>123 watts of power</strong>. This means that you can conveniently power devices like IP cameras, VoIP phones, and access points directly through the Ethernet cable. Imagine not having to fuss around with additional power supplies cluttering your workspace.</p> <h3>Benefits of PoE</h3> <p>Utilizing PoE technology can significantly reduce installation costs and simplify your setup. You’ll appreciate the clean installation without tangled wires snaking across the floor. It also allows greater flexibility in where you can place devices, leading to more efficient network layout without the constraints of electrical outlets.</p> <h2>VLAN for Added Security</h2> <h3>Enhanced Business Security</h3> <p>The ability to assign <strong>VLAN IDs</strong> (Virtual Local Area Network Identifiers) to each of the Ethernet ports enhances overall security. You can create separate networks for different departments or functions within your business. This way, even if one part of the network experiences issues, it won’t spill over and affect the others.</p> <h3>Why You Need VLANs</h3> <p>Using VLANs helps to isolate sensitive data from less secure areas of your network, which can protect against unauthorized access. For instance, if you have a guest network, segmenting it from your internal operations can keep your sensitive information intact.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="ASUS ExpertWiFi EBG19P Gigabit PoE+ VPN Wired Router, 8 PoE+ Ports, 123W, Up to 3 WAN ethernet Ports+ 1 USB WAN, Perfect for APs, Commercial-Grade Network Security, Easy Management ExpertWiFi app" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D85KDWML?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Find your new ASUS ExpertWiFi EBG19P Gigabit PoE+ VPN Wired Router, 8 PoE+ Ports, 123W, Up to 3 WAN ethernet Ports+ 1 USB WAN, Perfect for APs, Commercial-Grade Network Security, Easy Management ExpertWiFi app on this page." href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D85KDWML?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>WAN Connectivity</h2> <h3>Understanding WAN Ports</h3> <p>The <strong>ASUS EBG19P</strong> supports <strong>up to 3 WAN ports</strong>: a gigabit WAN port and two gigabit WAN/LAN ports. This load balancing feature optimizes your internet speed by efficiently distributing loads across multiple connections. If one WAN connection fails, the router automatically routes traffic through another WAN port, ensuring continued connectivity.</p> <h3>The USB WAN Option</h3> <p>In addition to standard WAN ports, the router features a <strong>USB WAN port</strong>, which can serve as a backup by connecting to your mobile phone's hotspot. This redundancy is crucial for maintaining a reliable internet connection, particularly for businesses that cannot afford any downtime.</p> <h2>Easy Device Management</h2> <h3>Centralized Control</h3> <p>With the <strong>ExpertWiFi app</strong>, managing your network becomes a breeze. This app allows you to centralize control over connected PoE devices, providing an intuitive user interface where you can monitor performance and usage.</p> <h3>User-Friendly Interface</h3> <p>You’ll love how simple it is to manage your network setup. Whether you’re adding a new device or troubleshooting an issue, you can do it all from your smartphone. The app exemplifies how managing a commercial-grade network doesn’t have to be complicated.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="ASUS ExpertWiFi EBG19P Gigabit PoE+ VPN Wired Router, 8 PoE+ Ports, 123W, Up to 3 WAN ethernet Ports+ 1 USB WAN, Perfect for APs, Commercial-Grade Network Security, Easy Management ExpertWiFi app" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D85KDWML?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Network Security Features</h2> <h3>Commercial-Grade Assurance</h3> <p>Security might be one of your top concerns when it comes to your business network. The <strong>ASUS EBG19P</strong> provides commercial-grade network security features, ensuring that your data remains safe from potential intrusions.</p> <h3>Safe Browsing & VPN Capabilities</h3> <p>With <strong>Safe Browsing</strong> features and built-in VPN capabilities, all your public WiFi connections will be securely encrypted. Plus, ASUS offers a free subscription to <strong>AiProtection Pro</strong>, packed with features like Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). These measures actively monitor traffic, blocking malicious attempts to breach your network.</p> <h3>Virtual Patching</h3> <p>The virtual patching feature protects you against known vulnerabilities, keeping your network resilient to attacks, which brings peace of mind, allowing you to focus on running your business effectively.</p> <h2>Performance and Speed</h2> <h3>Gigabit Capabilities</h3> <p>When it comes to speed, the <strong>ASUS ExpertWiFi EBG19P</strong> supports <strong>Gigabit ethernet</strong>, ensuring that all devices connected work at optimal speeds, providing smooth streaming and data transfers.</p> <h3>Multi-User Support</h3> <p>If your business has multiple employees working concurrently on the network, you can expect seamless performance.
