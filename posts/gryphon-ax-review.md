Rather than relying on a single router to cover your entire home, which can often leave dead zones, a mesh system utilizes multiple units that work together to blanket your space in reliable internet. The Gryphon AX leverages this technology, ensuring that every corner of your home receives a strong signal.</p> <h3>Speed and Coverage</h3> <p>Thanks to its AX4300 technology, the Gryphon AX delivers impressive speeds of up to 4.3 Gbps. This means you can enjoy buffer-free streaming, quick downloads, and smooth online gaming, even when multiple devices are connected. With coverage extending up to 3,000 square feet, there's a good chance that no area in your home would be left without strong WiFi.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Specification</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Max Speed</td> <td>Up to 4.3 Gbps</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Coverage</td> <td>Up to 3,000 sq. ft.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Technology</td> <td>Mesh WiFi 6</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Device Support</td> <td>Multi-device households</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Advanced Parental Controls</h2> <h3>Why Are Parental Controls Important?</h3> <p>If you have children, keeping them safe online is likely a top priority for you.
