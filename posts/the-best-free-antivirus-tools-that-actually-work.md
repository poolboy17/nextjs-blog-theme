Always look for the <strong>HTTPS</strong> protocol, which indicates a secure connection, especially if you are about to enter any sensitive information. Browser extensions that check for the authenticity of sites can further bolster your defenses.</p>

<p>In email, skepticism serves as your safest ally. Treat unsolicited emails with caution, examining every link and attachment carefully. Cybercriminals often exploit human behavior, leading you to click on links or download files that appear harmless. Consider utilizing email services that incorporate built-in phishing protection and automatically flag suspicious messages. This dual approach—both analytical (scrutinizing the email content) and technological (leveraging protective services)—can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to these common scams.</p>

<p>Another effective strategy is to use distinct and robust passwords for different online accounts. Password managers can assist in generating and storing complex passwords, making it easier for you to avoid reusing credentials. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) serves as an added layer of security; by requiring a secondary verification method, it ensures that even if your password is compromised, your account remains secure. Following these practices diligently not only protects you but also reduces the chances of your account being a gateway for attacks on others within your organization or social circle.</p>

<h3>Staying informed: Resources for emerging threats and security practices</h3>
