It’s compatible with over 30 VPN service providers, enabling you to secure your internet connection when you're connected to public Wi-Fi.</p> <p>What’s even better is its max VPN speeds: you can enjoy up to 28 Mbps with OpenVPN and an impressive 170 Mbps with WireGuard. This kind of speed means you don’t have to sacrifice performance for security.</p> <h2>Network Storage Capabilities</h2> <h3>Creating Your Own Cloud</h3> <p>If you often need to store and share documents, you'll appreciate the GL-A1300's network storage feature. By plugging an external USB hard drive into the router, you can create a private network storage. This means you have secure access to your files no matter where you are.</p> <p>This is especially convenient if you frequently collaborate with others or if you're working on a big project and need to share files quickly.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="GL.iNet GL-A1300 Pocket VPN Travel Router - Portable Wi-Fi Router for Travel, Easy to Set up, Connect to Public Hotel Wi-Fi login Page" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4ZSR2PX?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Versatile Usage Scenarios</h2> <h3>Great for All Locations</h3> <p>Whether you're at a hotel, café, airport, or even a restaurant, the GL-A1300 is versatile enough for all sorts of environments. Since it’s small and lightweight (measuring 118 x 84 x 33 mm and weighing just 429g), you can carry it easily in your bag.</p> <p>If you often find yourself needing secure internet access, this device proves to be a lifesaver. Imagine sipping coffee at a café while ensuring that your connection is not as insecure as it might otherwise be.</p> <h2>VPN Internet Kill Switch</h2> <h3>Your Safety Net</h3> <p>The VPN Internet Kill Switch is a fascinating feature. This mechanism activates an automatic shut off for all Internet traffic if your VPN connection drops. If you have this feature enabled and the VPN client isn’t running, your connected devices won’t be able to access the internet at all.</p> <p>This ensures your data remains safe and secure, instead of risking exposure on an unsecured public network.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="GL.iNet GL-A1300 Pocket VPN Travel Router - Portable Wi-Fi Router for Travel, Easy to Set up, Connect to Public Hotel Wi-Fi login Page" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4ZSR2PX?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>VPN Policies</h2> <h3>Your Connection, Your Rules</h3> <p>The GL-A1300 allows you to define VPN routing policies, meaning you can use a VPN for specific websites or IPs while keeping your regular internet connection for others. This feature adds flexibility, so you can choose which activities require the added layer of security without impacting your entire browsing experience.</p> <h2>Ease of Use</h2> <h3>Toggle Switch Features</h3> <p>With the GL-A1300, enabling or disabling important features is super easy. A physical toggle switch lets you control whether to activate AdGuard Home or OpenVPN/WireGuard clients quickly.</p> <p>Keep in mind, the default function of this button is set to "No Function," so be sure to configure it in the admin panel first to use it efficiently.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="GL.iNet GL-A1300 Pocket VPN Travel Router - Portable Wi-Fi Router for Travel, Easy to Set up, Connect to Public Hotel Wi-Fi login Page" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4ZSR2PX?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>AdGuard Home Integration</h2> <h3>Block Ads and Tracking</h3> <p>AdGuard Home is integrated into this router, giving you network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. Once set up, this feature covers all of your home devices without needing client-side software.</p> <p>Setting up AdGuard Home can enhance your browsing experience significantly. You won’t find those annoying pop-ups or trackers invading your online space.</p> <h2>Encrypted DNS with Cloudflare</h2> <h3>Added Layer of Security</h3> <p>The GL-A1300 supports DNS over TLS, a protocol aimed at enhancing your privacy and security online. This encryption prevents eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data that is often a target for cyber-attacks.</p> <p>The integration with Cloudflare gives you not only enhanced speed but also a boost to your online security — both of which are extremely important when you're on the go.</p> <h2>Guest Wi-Fi Network</h2> <h3>Keeping Your Network Secure</h3> <p>Another impressive feature of the GL-A1300 is the ability to separate your private Wi-Fi and guest Wi-Fi networks. Creating a guest network means your visitors can access the internet without gaining access to your main home network.</p> <p>This adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that your devices remain protected from potential threats or unwanted snooping when you have guests.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The GL.iNet GL-A1300 Pocket VPN Travel Router is more than just a handy gadget; it’s a comprehensive solution for anyone who wants secure and reliable internet access while on the move. From its dual-band speeds to its customizable options, this router is designed to cater to your unique needs.</p> <p>Whether you're a frequent traveler or just someone who often finds themselves in environments with questionable internet security, this router has you covered. With convenient features like a VPN client, network storage capabilities, and the ability to create guest networks, you get a lot of value in a tiny package.</p> <p>Consider making the GL-A1300 a part of your tech arsenal. It might just transform your experience of connecting to the internet, ensuring you can work, surf, and stream safely and securely, wherever life takes you.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="See the GL.iNet GL-A1300 Pocket VPN Travel Router - Portable Wi-Fi Router for Travel, Easy to Set up, Connect to Public Hotel Wi-Fi login Page in detail." href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4ZSR2PX?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <p><i>Disclosure: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</i></p>
