You might have heard the horror stories about gamers falling victim to ransomware or viruses that sabotage their devices. With this advanced security, you can enjoy peace of mind knowing that you’re protected against both existing and emerging malware threats.</p> <p>Think about it: you’re in the middle of a crucial game, and the last thing you want is some malicious software trying to wreak havoc on your device. Norton 360 keeps an eye on things, ensuring that up to three of your devices remain secure.</p> <h3>Multiple Device Coverage</h3> <p>One purchase unlocks protection for up to three devices. Whether you're gaming on a PC, laptop, or another compatible device, you're covered. This feature is especially great for those who like to game on multiple devices—maybe you switch it up between your gaming rig and your laptop. You'll appreciate knowing that they're all safeguarded without needing multiple subscriptions.</p> <h2>Game Optimizer</h2> <p>How many times have you experienced lag during an intense gaming moment? It can be frustrating when your performance falters, especially if you’re in a competitive setting. Norton’s Game Optimizer kicks in by maximizing your game performance.</p> <h3>Dedication of CPU Cores</h3> <p>This feature works by dedicating CPU cores specifically to the game you're playing, which is a game-changer for PCs with multi-core CPUs. You can feel the difference as your system runs more efficiently, allowing you to focus on your strategy rather than worrying about frame drops or stuttering.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Norton 360 for Gamers 2024, Multiple layers of protection for up to 3 Devices – Includes Game Optimizer, Gamer tag monitoring, Secure VPN and PC Cloud Backup [Download]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C81ZCXX?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Learn more about the Norton 360 for Gamers 2024, Multiple layers of protection for up to 3 Devices – Includes Game Optimizer, Gamer tag monitoring, Secure VPN and PC Cloud Backup [Download] here." href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C81ZCXX?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Dark Web Monitoring</h2> <p>Imagine you find out your gamer tag or email address has been compromised online. It’s not a pleasant thought, and that’s where Norton’s Dark Web Monitoring comes into play. This feature monitors the dark web for any signs of your personal information being misused.</p> <h3>Real-Time Notifications</h3> <p>If Norton finds any of your information, like your gamer tags or usernames, you’ll receive a notification. The sense of security it provides is invaluable, especially for those who take their gaming identity seriously. Staying informed is key, and with this feature, you won’t be left in the dark.</p> <h2>Secure VPN</h2> <p>You likely know how important online security is—especially in today’s world. Norton 360 offers a Secure VPN that ensures your browsing remains anonymous and protected. Do you use public Wi-Fi to game or browse? If you do, this feature is particularly vital.</p> <h3>Protection Against DDoS Attacks</h3> <p>With a VPN, your IP address gets hidden, which is essential for defending against DDoS attacks, doxxing, and SWATing incidents—things no gamer should ever have to face. Connecting through a secure tunnel helps keep your online activities private, so you can focus on your gameplay without any unnecessary anxiety about your safety.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Norton 360 for Gamers 2024, Multiple layers of protection for up to 3 Devices – Includes Game Optimizer, Gamer tag monitoring, Secure VPN and PC Cloud Backup [Download]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C81ZCXX?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>PC Notification Optimization</h2> <p>Nobody enjoys constant notifications, especially when they’re in the heat of battle.

If your PC is under attack or something’s gone awry with your protection, you’ll be alerted. This focus on relevant alerts means you can game without incessant pop-ups disrupting your flow.</p> <h2>50GB PC Cloud Backup</h2> <p>Is your gaming library getting a little too full? That’s where the 50GB PC Cloud Backup feature comes in. This automatic backup will securely store your game clips and important files online, freeing up valuable space on your local drives.</p> <h3>Peace of Mind and Space Management</h3> <p>Storing your game clips online not only rests your storage space but also ensures that you won’t lose any crucial moments from your gaming adventures. Knowing your accomplishments are backed up online can give you peace of mind, so you can focus entirely on your gaming experience.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Norton 360 for Gamers 2024, Multiple layers of protection for up to 3 Devices – Includes Game Optimizer, Gamer tag monitoring, Secure VPN and PC Cloud Backup [Download]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C81ZCXX?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Additional Features</h2> <h3>User-Friendly Interface</h3> <p>Navigating through Norton 360 for Gamers is straightforward.
