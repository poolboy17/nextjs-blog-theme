The NETGEAR Nighthawk X4S offers up to AC2600 wireless speed. This is broken down into dual bands: 800 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band and 1733 Mbps on the 5GHz band. This means you can enjoy seamless browsing, gaming, and streaming throughout your home.</p> <p>Imagine spreading all that crispy bandwidth over a coverage area of up to 2500 square feet. No more dead zones! Whether you're in your living room catching up on your favorite show or in the home office grinding out work, you can be confident that your connection will remain strong and reliable.</p> <h3>Simultaneous Dual Band Technology</h3> <p>One of the standout features of the Nighthawk X4S is its simultaneous dual-band technology. What does this mean for you? Well, you can connect multiple devices across both frequencies without sacrificing performance. This is crucial for households with many devices, where users are simultaneously streaming, gaming, and working.</p> <p>And speaking of devices, this router can support up to 45 of them at the same time! So whether you have smartphones, smart TVs, tablets, or gaming consoles, there's plenty of bandwidth to go around.</p> <h3>Wired Ethernet Ports</h3> <p>For those times when you prefer a more stable connection – like for competitive gaming or streaming high-definition content – the Nighthawk X4S comes loaded with 4 gigabit Ethernet ports. This means you can plug in your computers, gaming consoles, or any other nearby devices to ensure maximum speed and reliability.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Types of Connections</strong></th> <th><strong>Number of Ports</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Gigabit Ethernet</td> <td>4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>USB 3.0</td> <td>2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>eSATA</td> <td>1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>A wired connection can be a game-changer, especially when you're sharing your network with multiple users.</p> <h2>Advanced Technology Features</h2> <p>When you're investing in a router, you want it to be loaded with features that enhance your experience. The Nighthawk X4S boasts a range of advanced technology that sets it apart from the competition.</p> <h3>Dual-Core Processor</h3> <p>At the heart of this router is a 1.7GHz dual-core processor. This powerful feature is crucial for handling multiple data streams simultaneously, allowing you to enjoy fast and smooth internet access even with numerous devices connected.</p> <h3>Amplified Antennas</h3> <p>With four amplified antennas, you'll be able to extend your WiFi signals even further. This feature ensures that the connection is stable, no matter where you are in your home. Say goodbye to those frustrating moments where you find yourself moving closer to the router just to get a decent signal!</p> <h3>Beamforming Technology</h3> <p>Beamforming technology focuses the WiFi signal directly to your devices rather than spreading it across a wide area. This improves signal strength and reduces interference, giving you a more reliable connection. It’s like having a direct pathway to a highway of internet speed.</p> <h3>MU-MIMO Support</h3> <p>MU-MIMO (Multi-User, Multiple Input, Multiple Output) allows the Nighthawk X4S to communicate with multiple devices simultaneously. If you have multiple people at home using the internet at once, this feature ensures everyone gets ample bandwidth, making it perfect for busy households.</p> <h3>Dynamic QoS</h3> <p>Dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) prioritizes internet traffic for bandwidth-intensive applications. If you often find yourself gaming or streaming while others are browsing the web, you’ll appreciate that dynamic QoS ensures your connection is given priority, leading to a smoother experience.</p> <h3>Amazon Alexa Voice Control</h3> <p>One of the fun extras is that the Nighthawk X4S supports Amazon Alexa voice controls. You can manage your WiFi and even take advantage of quick commands to check your connection or pause the internet for specific devices, which can be super handy.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="NETGEAR Nighthawk X4S Smart WiFi Router (R7800) - AC2600 Wireless Speed (up to 2600 Mbps) | Up to 2500 sq ft Coverage 45 Devices | 4 x 1G Ethernet, 2 x 3.0 USB, and 1 x eSATA ports" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0192911RA?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Discover more about the NETGEAR Nighthawk X4S Smart WiFi Router (R7800) - AC2600 Wireless Speed (up to 2600 Mbps) | Up to 2500 sq ft Coverage 45 Devices | 4 x 1G Ethernet, 2 x 3.0 USB, and 1 x eSATA ports." href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0192911RA?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>USB Connections</h2> <p>In a world where sharing resources and files is becoming increasingly important, the Nighthawk X4S has your back with its multiple USB ports.</p> <h3>3.0 USB Ports</h3> <p>With two USB 3.0 ports, you can easily share a printer or storage devices with any connected device on your network.
