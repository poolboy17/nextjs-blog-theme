McAfee Total Protection allows you to cover three devices with a single subscription. This means you won’t need to worry about multiple subscriptions or juggling different security solutions for different devices.</p> <h3>Benefits of Multi-Device Protection</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Simplicity</strong>: One solution for all your devices simplifies management.</li> <li> <strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: Instead of paying for individual licenses, you save money.</li> <li> <strong>Comprehensive Coverage</strong>: Your phones, tablets, and computers all receive the same high level of protection.</li> </ul> <h2>Unlimited VPN</h2> <p>Connecting to public Wi-Fi can leave your data vulnerable. With McAfee Total Protection, you're equipped with an unlimited VPN that encrypts your internet connection, making it safer to browse, bank, or shop online.</p> <h3>Why Use a VPN?</h3> <p>A VPN (Virtual Private Network) masks your IP address and encrypts your internet traffic.
