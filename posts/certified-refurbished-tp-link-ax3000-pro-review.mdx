This means that with 2402 Mbps on the 5 GHz range and 574 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band, you can seamlessly stream, game, and browse without interruptions.</p> <h3>Breakdown of Speed</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Band</th> <th>Speed</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>5 GHz</td> <td>2402 Mbps</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2.4 GHz</td> <td>574 Mbps</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total</td> <td>3000 Mbps</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>These speeds are perfect for families or households with multiple users streaming or gaming simultaneously.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Certified Refurbished TP-Link AX3000 Pro WiFi 6 Router (Archer AX55 Pro) - Multi-Gigabit Wireless Internet, 2.5 Gbps Port, VPN, OFDMA, MU-MIMO, WPA3, Alexa Compatible (Renewed)" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWBVZ92V?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Learn more about the Certified Refurbished TP-Link AX3000 Pro WiFi 6 Router (Archer AX55 Pro) - Multi-Gigabit Wireless Internet, 2.5 Gbps Port, VPN, OFDMA, MU-MIMO, WPA3, Alexa Compatible (Renewed) here." href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWBVZ92V?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Connect More Devices: No More Bandwidth Issues</h2> <p>Are you tired of buffering when too many devices are connected? With the revolutionary OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) and MU-MIMO (Multi-User, Multiple Input, Multiple Output) technology, the Archer AX3000 Pro allows for simultaneous communication with more devices. This means your streaming devices can work flawlessly alongside your gaming consoles and smart home devices.</p> <h3>Understanding OFDMA and MU-MIMO</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>OFDMA</strong>: This technology divides channels into smaller sub-channels, allowing more devices to transmit data at the same time.</li> <li> <strong>MU-MIMO</strong>: This feature helps the router communicate with multiple devices concurrently, rather than one at a time.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these innovations translate to a significant uplift in network efficiency, ensuring every device has a consistent connection.</p> <h2>More Reliable Coverage: Signal Strength Where You Need It</h2> <p>How often do you find yourself moving around your home only to lose Wi-Fi signal? The Archer AX3000 Pro counters that by using Beamforming technology combined with four antennas. This setup focuses the signal strength directly towards your devices, significantly enhancing coverage and performance.</p> <h3>Antenna Setup</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Details</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Number of Antennas</td> <td>4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Technology</td> <td>Beamforming</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Coverage Quality</td> <td>Strong and Reliable</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>You’ll be able to enjoy a solid connection not just in the room with the router, but throughout your entire home.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Certified Refurbished TP-Link AX3000 Pro WiFi 6 Router (Archer AX55 Pro) - Multi-Gigabit Wireless Internet, 2.5 Gbps Port, VPN, OFDMA, MU-MIMO, WPA3, Alexa Compatible (Renewed)" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWBVZ92V?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Ultra Wired Connectivity: Flexibility That Matters</h2> <p>In a world where streaming media and online gaming demand optimal performance, having the right physical connections is crucial.
