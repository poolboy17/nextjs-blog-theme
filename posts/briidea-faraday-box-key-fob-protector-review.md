This means if you put your car key fob inside the box, any signals it emits—usually used for keyless entry—are effectively nullified. As a result, thieves using signal boosters can’t pick up your key's signal, protecting you from potential theft. It’s more than just a box; it’s a fortress for your car keys.</p> <h3>Key Features of the briidea Faraday Box</h3> <p>This product boasts an array of features that truly elevate it above the competition.
