<p>What’s the first thing you think about when you're setting up your home network? Is it speed, security, or maybe the number of devices you can connect? With the ASUS (RT-N10+) Wireless-N 150 Entry Home Router, you get a solid combination of all those features, making it a great choice for your home networking needs.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="ASUS (RT-N10+) Wireless-N 150 Entry Home Router: Fast Ethernet and support upto 4 Guest SSID(Open source DDWRT support),Black" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003H98YK4?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Click to view the ASUS (RT-N10+) Wireless-N 150 Entry Home Router: Fast Ethernet and support upto 4 Guest SSID(Open source DDWRT support),Black." href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003H98YK4?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Design and Build Quality</h2> <p>The first thing you'll notice about the ASUS RT-N10+ is its sleek, black design. It’s compact and understated, which means it can fit seamlessly into any home décor. You won’t need to hide it away; it can sit comfortably on your desk or shelf.</p> <h3>Size and Dimensions</h3> <p>This router is lightweight, and its small footprint ensures it won't overwhelm your space. It’s easy to relocate if needed, and you won’t struggle to find a place for it in your home office or living room.</p> <h3>Ports and Connectivity</h3> <p>On the back, you’ll find one WAN port for connecting to your Internet source and four LAN ports for connecting your wired devices. This configuration is quite typical for routers in this price range, but it offers plenty of options for wired connections if you have gaming consoles, PCs, or smart TVs that you prefer to connect directly.</p> <h3>Antenna</h3> <p>Equipped with a 3dbi external fixed antenna, the router provides decent Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home. However, if your home has several levels or thick walls, be mindful that the signal strength might not reach every corner effortlessly.</p> <h2>Performance</h2> <p>When it comes to performance, the ASUS RT-N10+ is designed to handle your everyday online activities.</p> <h3>Speed</h3> <p>The router supports a data rate of up to 150 Mbps. This speed is adequate for standard uses like browsing, streaming music, or video calls. However, if you're a heavy user who streams 4K videos or plays online games, you might find this router a bit limiting.</p> <h3>Distance</h3> <p>You'll typically find that the 2.4GHz frequency band manages well over a decent range. It can handle several devices at once, which is essential if you're a multi-device household. Just keep in mind that obstacles like walls and appliances can impact the signal strength.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="ASUS (RT-N10+) Wireless-N 150 Entry Home Router: Fast Ethernet and support upto 4 Guest SSID(Open source DDWRT support),Black" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003H98YK4?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="See the ASUS (RT-N10+) Wireless-N 150 Entry Home Router: Fast Ethernet and support upto 4 Guest SSID(Open source DDWRT support),Black in detail." href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003H98YK4?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> </p><p></p><p><h2>Key Features</h2> <h3>EZQoS (Easy Quality of Service)</h3> <p>One of the standout features of this router is EZQoS. It allows multiple network activities to function smoothly at the same time. Whether you’re gaming, streaming movies, or downloading large files, it prioritizes your internet traffic efficiently.</p> <h3>Security</h3> <p>Security shouldn't be sidelined when choosing a router. The ASUS RT-N10+ includes both NAT and SPI firewall options, which help protect your home network from intrusions. If you're someone who values a secure home network, this feature should give you peace of mind.</p> <h3>Guest Network Support</h3> <p>If you've ever had guests over and needed to share your Wi-Fi, you’ll appreciate the four Guest SSIDs. This function lets you create separate networks for guests while keeping your primary network secure. Plus, you can configure their access permissions easily.</p> <h3>Web Browser Upgrades</h3> <p>The router supports firmware upgrades via a web browser, making it easy for you to keep your device updated without needing any extra software. This ensures you have the latest features and security patches.</p> <h3>Configuration Files</h3> <p>Another handy feature is the ability to save and restore configuration files. Whether you’re troubleshooting or simply want to switch settings for a different use case, this feature will come in useful.</p> <h2>User Interface</h2> <h3>Web Configuration Page</h3> <p>The router’s management interface is user-friendly. Thanks to the Smart Wizard, which guides you through the setup process, even those who are not tech-savvy can configure the router without issues. This means that you can easily make adjustments as your needs change.</p> <h3>Remote Management</h3> <p>If you ever need to manage your network while away from home, the remote management feature comes in handy. Imagine being able to tweak settings or check on your network without having to physically be in front of the router. It’s definitely a feature that enhances convenience.</p> <h3>Repeater/Router/Bridge Mode</h3> <p>For those looking for versatility, the ASUS RT-N10+ can operate in three different modes: as a standard router, a repeater to extend the range of an existing network, or a bridge to connect wired devices to a wireless network. This makes it a great option for various networking environments.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="ASUS (RT-N10+) Wireless-N 150 Entry Home Router: Fast Ethernet and support upto 4 Guest SSID(Open source DDWRT support),Black" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003H98YK4?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> <h2>Setting Up</h2> <h3>Ease of Installation</h3> <p>Setting up the ASUS RT-N10+ is largely hassle-free. You can have it running within minutes by following the on-screen prompts, especially useful if you’re new to home networking. Just connect it to your modem, power it on, and follow the instructions through the web interface.</p> <h3>Configuration Process</h3> <p>After connecting, you'll access the configuration page by typing the default IP address into your web browser. From there, you can set up your SSIDs, passwords, and more. If you're unsure about anything, the Smart Wizard will guide you step-by-step.</p> <h3>Save/Restore Configurations</h3> <p>Should anything go wrong or if you need to revert to previous settings, the ability to save and restore configurations ensures you don't have to start from scratch. This feature is sometimes overlooked but can save you a lot of headaches.</p> <h2>Comparisons</h2> <p>It’s always a good idea to see how a product stacks against others in its category.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>ASUS (RT-N10+)</th> <th>Competitor A</th> <th>Competitor B</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Maximum Speed</td> <td>Up to 150 Mbps</td> <td>Up to 300 Mbps</td> <td>Up to 150 Mbps</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Number of LAN Ports</td> <td>4</td> <td>4</td> <td>2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Guest Network Support</td> <td>Yes, 4 Guest SSIDs</td> <td>Yes, 1 Guest SSID</td> <td>No</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Security Features</td> <td>NAT, SPI</td> <td>NAT only</td> <td>NAT, SPI</td> </tr> <tr> <td>EZQoS Feature</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>No</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Firmware Upgrades</td> <td>Web Browser</td> <td>Requires software</td> <td>Web Browser</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>From the table above, you can see that ASUS holds its own well against competitors.
