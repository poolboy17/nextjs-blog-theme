This tech isn’t just a numerical upgrade; it brings real-world improvements that can make a significant difference in your daily online activities.</p> <h3>Faster Speeds</h3> <p>One of the standout features of the G3100 is its speed. Users can enjoy an average of 60% faster speeds on the 2.4 GHz band and a whopping 38% faster on the 5 GHz band when compared to older Verizon routers. This improvement means less buffering when streaming videos, quicker downloads, and smoother gaming experiences.</p> <h3>Increased Capacity</h3> <p>With more devices connected to the home network than ever, modern routers need to handle heavy loads. The G3100’s architecture supports multiple connections without compromising speed, making it suitable for families with numerous smart devices, computers, and mobile gadgets.</p> <h2>Tri-Band Antennas for Better Coverage</h2> <p>Coverage can be a challenge when it comes to home Wi-Fi. The Verizon/Fios Home Router G3100 addresses this issue with its tri-band 4x4 antennas.</p> <h3>What Do Tri-Band Antennas Mean for You?</h3> <p>Tri-band antennas mean more channels for your devices to connect to. This feature increases Wi-Fi coverage by an average of 63%. Imagine being able to move around your home without losing that internet connectivity – whether it’s streaming your favorite show in the living room or attending a video call in the kitchen.</p> <h3>Effective Signal Distribution</h3> <p>The router's smart design optimizes signal distribution throughout your home. No more struggling to maintain a strong connection in the corners of your house. With the G3100, you can expect a robust signal in every nook and cranny.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lljJheAeM4s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Discover more about the Verizon/Fios Home Router G3100 (Renewed)." href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KPXTXQG?tag=8118903-20" style='text-decoration: none; box-shadow: none;'></a></p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Ready for Gigabit Speeds</h2> <p>When it comes to wired connections, the G3100 doesn’t fall short either.</p> <h3>Gigabit LAN Ports</h3> <p>The router includes 4 Gigabit LAN ports and 1 Gigabit WAN port, allowing you to connect devices directly for the fastest possible internet experience.
