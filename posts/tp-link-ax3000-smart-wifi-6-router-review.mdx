This isn't just a marketing buzzword; it brings significant improvements over its predecessor, Wi-Fi 5. You’re looking at speeds up to three times faster, four times the capacity, and an impressive 75% reduction in latency. What does this mean for you? Smooth streaming, quick downloads, and efficient multitasking without frustrating interruptions.</p> <h3>Speed Enhancements</h3> <p>Can you imagine downloading large files or streaming 4K content without any buffering? With this router, you’re not just dreaming; it’s a reality. The Dual Band feature allows you to achieve speeds up to 3 Gbps—2,402 Mbps on the 5 GHz band and 574 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. Whether you’re gaming, streaming movies, or video chatting, your experience will be noticeably quicker.</p> <h2>Multi-Device Connectivity</h2> <p>How often have you found your connection slowing down because multiple devices are competing for bandwidth?
