Well, it’s all about the cloud-based protection that Webroot offers. Unlike traditional antivirus software, which can sometimes slow down your devices, Webroot runs in the cloud – meaning that it uses online resources to identify and respond to threats. This results in faster performance and more effective scanning.</p> <h3>Key Features</h3> <p>Let’s break down the features that come with the Webroot Internet Security Plus package:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Cloud-Based Protection</td> <td>Provides real-time protection against viruses and other online threats.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Password Manager</td> <td>Webroot Password Manager encrypts and saves your passwords, so you only need to remember one.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Automatic Updates</td> <td>Software updates itself in the background, ensuring you always have the latest protection.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Multi-Device Protection</td> <td>Works on PC, Mac, Chromebook, Android, and iOS devices.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ransomware and Phishing Protection</td> <td>Protects against ransomware attacks and phishing attempts, keeping your data secure.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>Sturdy Protection Across All Your Devices</h3> <p>One of the best aspects of Webroot Internet Security Plus is its ability to protect multiple devices.
