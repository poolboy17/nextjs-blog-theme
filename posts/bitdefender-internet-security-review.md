You can easily switch to game, movie, or work mode, ensuring that notifications won’t disturb your experience while maximizing performance. It’s the perfect companion for when you want to go fully immersed without interruptions.</p> <h3>OneClick Optimizer</h3> <p>Speed does not only mean protection; it also pertains to the overall performance of your device.
