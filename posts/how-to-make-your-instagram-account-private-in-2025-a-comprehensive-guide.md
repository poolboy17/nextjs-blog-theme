Each post, story, or DM carries the potential risk of being seen by anyone if your account is public. In 2025, users are more exposed than ever to various threats such as cyberbullying, stalking, and data harvesting. These aren't just abstract ideas; they affect real people's lives. The convenience of sharing your life with the world can come at a hefty price if you’re not aware of who’s watching.</p> <p>Making your account private gives you control. It allows you to determine who can see your content and interact with you. You want your online experience to be safe, secure, and tailored to your comfort level. By opting for a private account, you can limit your audience to only those you know and trust.</p> <h2>Steps to Make Your Instagram Account Private in 2025</h2> <p>Now that you understand the importance of privacy, let’s walk through the steps to make your Instagram account private.
